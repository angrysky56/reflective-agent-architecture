Functional Morality: Field-Ready Operational Framework
This synthesis integrates sociobiological grounding, quantified harm thresholds, and structural power analysis into a self-correcting operational system.

1. Empirical Foundations & Trigger Thresholds
Basis: Haidt’s Moral Foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness) constrained by Wilson’s epigenetic rules. Operational Triggers: Intervention is automatically triggered if >30% of a population breaches the following validated baselines:

Psychological Harm: WHO-5 Well-Being Index < 50 (raw score).
Quality of Life: WHOQOL-BREF < 60 (domain score).
Mental Distress: GHQ-12 > 3 symptomatic items.
Validation Standard: Minimum sample size n=30 per subgroup, Cronbach’s alpha > 0.70.
2. Standardized Field Protocols (The 4-Phase Cycle)
Phase 1: Context Mapping (Week 1): Rapid ethnographic assessment.
Phase 2: Power Audit (MSIM): Mandatory Multi-level Stakeholder Influence Mapping.
Gate Rule: Phase 2 -> 3 requires >40% marginalized group voice in the process.
Phase 3: Harm Assessment: Administration of WHO/GHQ instruments.
Phase 4: Co-Design: Community-led intervention design using the Equity Formula.
3. Structural Power & Resource Allocation
Equity Formula: Resource_Allocation = (Population * Vulnerability_Index) + Base_Cost.
Constraint: 30% of all funds must go directly to local grassroots organizations.
Remediation Mechanism:
Veto Right: Triggered if Power Imbalance > 20% (Gini > 0.4) for affected groups.
Risk Mitigation: "Safe Passage" guarantees and transition roles for displaced elites to prevent sabotage.
4. Case Application: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)
Goal: 90% reduction in procedures for under-15s within 3 years.
Mechanism: Alternative Rites of Passage (ARP) – preserving cultural initiation without cutting.
Transition Plan: Retrain traditional cutters as Community Health Workers (midwives) to maintain status/income.
Fidelity: Voluntary, anonymized medical checkups.
Sunset Clause: 5-year phase-out of external support.
5. Case Application: Child Marriage
Goal: Zero marriages under 18.
Mechanism: Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) linked to 90% school attendance.
Governance: Village Child Protection Committees with 50% female quota.
Economic Case: ROI $1 : $15 (health savings + lifetime earnings).
Enforcement: Community Bylaws with graduated sanctions (Education -> Suspension of CCT -> Legal).
6. Quality Assurance & Conflict Resolution
Fidelity: Intervention Integrity Index (III) monitored monthly.
Consensus: Deep Democracy method – minority views must be integrated, not just outvoted.
Conflict Rule: In any clash between Cultural Preservation and Bodily Integrity, Harm Metrics (WHO-5) always supersede.
Escalation: Simultaneous triggers (e.g., Harm + Power Imbalance) activate Emergency Response Mode, bypassing standard consultation for immediate protection.
