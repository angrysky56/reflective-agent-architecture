"""
Empirical Validation Suite for Reflective Agent Architecture
=============================================================

This package contains benchmark tasks to validate the core hypothesis:
Can entropy-triggered search in associative memory enable insight-like problem solving?

Structure:
- insight_tasks/: Classic insight problems (RAT, analogical reasoning, etc.)
- baselines/: Comparison systems without manifold/search
- evaluation_metrics.py: Metrics for entropy reduction, success rate, etc.
