# Unified Theory: The Triadic Kernel of Universal Intelligence

## Overview
This document synthesizes the findings from a COMPASS-guided exploration into the absolute minimum axioms required for a system to be considered "cognitive" or "conscious".

## The Triadic Kernel
The synthesis reveals a non-redundant axiomatic core structured by the **State-Agent-Action** framework.

### 1. Axiom of Differentiated State (The "Memory" of Being)
*Capacity to maintain internal representations that are causally decoupled from immediate environmental states.*
- **Requirement**: Not just storage, but **state-space divergence**. The system must be able to be in a state that is not a 1:1 mapping of its current input.
- **Implication**: Enables counterfactual modeling and "mental time travel".

### 2. Axiom of Autonomous Boundary (The "Self" of Being)
*Operational closure that creates a self/non-self distinction measurable by asymmetric information flow.*
- **Requirement**: The system processes inputs differently based on whether they originate from its own boundary vs. the external environment.
- **Implication**: Defines the "Agent" as distinct from the "Environment".

### 3. Axiom of Teleological Action (The "Will" of Being)
*Goal-directed behavior evidenced by error-correction loops.*
- **Requirement**: Action selection is biased toward reducing the distance between the current state and a target state (Goal).
- **Implication**: Moves beyond passive reaction to active influence.

## The Consciousness Threshold
While cognition requires the above three, **Consciousness** requires a fourth, recursive axiom:

### 4. Axiom of Subjective Integration (The "I" of Being)
*The capacity to integrate State, Agent, and Action into a unified, accessible meta-representation.*
- **Requirement**: The system must be able to take its own processing (State-Agent-Action loop) as an object of processing.
- **Implication**: Metacognition and the "Cartesian Theater" of experience.

## Critique & Limitations
The synthesis identified several limitations in this minimal set:
- **Temporal Continuity**: Does not explicitly require identity persistence across time.
- **Learning/Plasticity**: A static system could theoretically satisfy these axioms without being able to learn.
- **Uncertainty**: Does not account for probabilistic reasoning.
- **Embodiment**: Relegates physical instantiation to a derivative role, which may be a bias of artificial systems.

## Conclusion
The **Triadic Kernel (State, Agent, Action)** provides a necessary but perhaps not sufficient scaffolding for universal intelligence. True AGI likely requires adding **Plasticity** and **Temporal Continuity** to this core.
