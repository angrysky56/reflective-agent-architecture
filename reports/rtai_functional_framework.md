# RTAI Functional Framework & Thought Node Registry
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Status:** Initial Draft

## 1. Functional Framework Definition
This document bridges the gap between the theoretical "Fractal Topological Metacognition" and a working codebase. It outlines how RTAI mechanisms (Gap Detection, Nacre Secretion, Pearl Formation) map to specific RAA computational processes.

### 1.1. Core Mapping
| RTAI Concept | RAA Component | Implementation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Topological Gap** | `SheafAnalyzer` / `Director` | Detect $H_1$ homology groups (cycles) or high entropy regions in the `Manifold`. |
| **Nacre Secretion** | `Hypothesize` / `HybridSearch` | Generate local coverings (hypotheses) to bound the uncertainty. |
| **Pearl Formation** | `Synthesize` / `Precuneus` | Merge coverings into a unified concept (The Pearl) and embedding it as a new primitive. |
| **Thermodynamics** | `Director` (Energy Budget) | Enforce $\Delta F > T \cdot \Delta S$ before committing a new Pearl to long-term memory. |

## 2. Thought Node Registry
*A persistent log of "Cognitive Pearls" – high-valency nodes that should be reused as anchors for future search and synthesis.*

| Concept Name | Node ID | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Big Bang Boundary Problem** | `thought_1765340337972195` | Problem | Root problem node for cosmological origin paradox |
| **t=0 Singularity Context** | `thought_1765340354313053` | Context | Where classical spacetime breaks down |
| **Ontological Investigator** | `thought_1765340356250900` | Perspective | Agent seeking to reconcile causality with origin |
| **5 Cosmological Hypotheses** | `thought_1765340357985453` | Operation | Evaluating quantum vacuum, cyclic models, etc. |
| **Gödelian Isomorphism** | `thought_1765340393917034` | Hypothesis | Origin paradox ≅ Gödel's Incompleteness (PROVED) |
| **Axiomatic Orthogonality Theory** | `thought_1765340461094093` | Synthesis | Big Bang as dimensional phase transition (8.5/10) |
| **Foundational Structure** | `thought_1765342719677127` | Problem | Deconstructing the proper selection function for reality |
| **Ontological Eigenvector** | `thought_1765342770087931` | Hypothesis | Physicality = Network Centrality ("Google Home Page" of Math) |
| **Theory of Orthogonal Reality** | `thought_1765342857387135` | Synthesis | Reality is the "Root Node" of the Multiverse (A- Grade) |

> **Usage Note**: To reuse these nodes, use their IDs in `synthesize(node_ids=[...])` or `hypothesize(node_a=...)`.

## 3. Exploration Plan
1.  **Populate Registry**: Use `inspect_graph` to find the IDs of the concepts generated in the previous session.
2.  **Verify Gaps**: Use `diagnose_pointer` or `sheaf_diagnostics` to find actual "holes" in the current knowledge graph.
3.  **Test Nacre Protocol**: Manually trigger `hypothesize` around a detected hole to simulate "nacre secretion".
